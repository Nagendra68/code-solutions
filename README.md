# ðŸ’» Daily Problem Solving: SQL, Competitive Programming, and DSA ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Daily Problem-Solving Repository**! ðŸŽ¯ This is where I document my journey of solving problems daily from **SQL**, **Competitive Programming (CP)**, and the **A2Z DSA Sheet**. The repository serves as a portfolio of my consistency, coding skills, and learning progress.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main folders:

- **SQL sol codes**: Contains solutions to SQL problems, along with queries .  
- **CodeForces cp codes**: Includes solutions to CP problems from Codeforces.  
- **A2Z_dsa_code**: Solutions to problems from the A2Z DSA Sheet.

Each folder has subdirectories for specific topics or problem sets.
